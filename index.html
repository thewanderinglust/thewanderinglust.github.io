            Heya! My name is Emily, and I'm <u>crazy</u> about games! Just <i>how</i> crazy?
          </p>
          <p>
            Very.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been making games since I was in middle school, teaching myself Game Maker and obsessing over creating <i>Super Mario World</i> hacks. As an adult, I attended Rochester Institute of Technology and earned my Masters degree in Game Design and Development. At RIT, I worked on several award-winning projects and completed my thesis: a deep-dive into the systems and interactions that designers create to simulate relationship-building in video games, and how designers can go further than the industry standard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I'm <i>so</i> crazy about games that upon graduation I entered the industry, joining Oxide Games in their endeavor to create <i>Ara: History Untold</i>. At Oxide, I've contributed a mountain of documentation and dozens of iterations on game content based on player feedback and balancing needs. I also applied my strong technical background to partner with engineers to improve the performance and extensibility of both gameplay systems and data tooling.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my personal time, I further hone my skills in both design and programming with "passion projects". I also play nearly any game I get my hands on! My goal in life is to keep growing, keep learning, and make awesome experiences. My philosophy is that games are worth more than the sum of their parts: they are not software, they are not stories, and they are not complex calculations carefully graphed in a series of spreadsheets. Games are an <i>experience</i>, and through reading, playing, and creating, I aim to become an expert at crafting experiences!
          </p>
          <p>
            Please enjoy a curated sampling of my favorite projects. If you like what you see, don't hesitate to reach out to me for any reason!
